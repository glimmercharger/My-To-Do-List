## My To Do List - Hack Club - Summer of code project.
## Hiya ✌
I made a To do list that you can run from your browser to your phone just download the files off GitHub or visit the live site at: [glimmercharger.github.io/My-To-Do-List](https://glimmercharger.github.io/My-To-Do-List/) (Coming soon please use the other link for now!)

You can also access it here: [To-do-list-Summerofcode.tiinyhost.com](https://to-do-listsummerofmakingcode.tiiny.site)

## How to use 😃
On the home page click on the text box write what you want and click add. Easy.

## How to use (Advanced) 🤓
If you want more advanced settings click on the 3 lines next to the add button - here you can export your list into a Exel spreadsheet (.CVS). You can also import the speadsheets to get your tasks back (even though your lists save to your browers memory). Turn Dark Mode on, setting how priority your important your task is, when is it due in and to sort your tasks by Importants etc.

## Saving the list 😇
As mentioned prevously you can save your tasks into a Exel Speadsheet document, but also it saves into your browser memory - (the tasks will be reset if you clear your browsing data so make sure you save it to Exel as you can import them later or finsh everything before you clear eveything).

## What I hope to do soon 💻
Adding an app you can download on your iPhone or Android Phone.

Adding a login system to save your tasks across the cloud.

Making it so the Web App tasks syncs across your network (Maybe).
